## Hi👋, I'm Jairo Lopez L. a **Frontend developer**

I am a software developer with 3 years of experience with frontend and backend knowledge, with the vision to project ideas and transform business requirements into code to make them a reality.
I have worked on projects among which I stand out:
- Build “no code” web app to generate web pages with just “drag and drop”.
- Integrate the Spain cadastre service to validate addresses during the payment checkout
of an ecommerce.
- Migrate a complete web into an Android app in React native.
In addition, I have 8 years of experience in the health and medicine logistics sector, during which I developed systemic thinking that allowed the adaptation, improvement, and optimization of different processes.
